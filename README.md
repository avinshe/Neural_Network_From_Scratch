Why waste time reinventing the wheel?

To put myself in the shoes of the inventor. 

After spending months in classroom learning the statistical computation behind artificial neurons, layers, losses, and back propagation, it almost feels like I am cheating when I provide inputs to a package it spits out the results. I started writing simple equations like sigmoid and softmax. Eventually got to defining loss function and updating weights through back propagation.

The code sucks with time complexity O(epochs*input_size). But it does the job with good accuracy. Perhaps, if I spent more time with literature review, I would be able to optimize the code. Who knows? Maybe I can build a whole new AI megacity if I spend enough time. No, I’m not crazy. I took an online assessment that said I’m very normal :)
